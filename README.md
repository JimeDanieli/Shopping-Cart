# Shopping-cart created with React

This is a simple proyect where the user can check all the products that are available and add them to the shopping cart (right corner).
Once a product is added to the cart, the user would be able to see a bubble alert where it shows the amount of products that there are in the cart.
There is also an option to check the cart detail
